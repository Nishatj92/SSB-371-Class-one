		<h1>Life of <span>Frida Kahlo </span></h1>
		<p> 

            Reading biographies opens up a new perspective about someone, makes you see the human underneath the perfect persona with all the layers and edges helping you relate; sometimes unexpectedly. While I knew about Frida Kahlo and her contribution in art, I was amazed when I read about the accomplished painterâ€™s life story. </p>

           <p> Born in Mexico City in the year <b>1907</b> she was known for her unique style of painting with vibrant colors and themes which were influenced by <i>Mexican and European cultures</i>. 
           	<br>About one-third of her paintings were self-portraits and through her beautiful paintings Frida reaped a sum greater than any of her fellow female artists at that time. Despite the name and fame, Frida deeply struggled in her personal life but attested her strength, perseverance, self-expression and art through perseverance, self-expression and art.
